number in round bracket is for 2019 spring DNP run list, which has 34 runs and 73525 files and is about 25% of the whole run range
number in square bracket is for 2019 spring short run list used for pass1 review, which has 13 runs and 18184 files and is about 6% of the whole run range

assumption
1.mon, 10 files per run and 5 iterations
2.calib, 1000 files of 5 runs for each run range and 5 iterations
3.decoding 1 file takes about 0.7 wall hour with 1 core for a single farm job
4.cooking 1 files takes about 2 wall hour with 16 core for a single farm job

Not counted
1. tape to disk time
2. job pending time
